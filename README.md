# Parking Spot Detection

This project implements a parking spot detection system using computer vision techniques with Python and OpenCV. The system processes a video feed to identify available parking spots based on predefined coordinates of parking spaces.

## Features

- Detects and highlights available parking spots in real-time from a video feed.
- Counts and displays the number of free parking spots.
- Outputs a processed video with marked parking spots.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- cvzone (`pip install cvzone`)

## Files

### 1. ParkingSpacePicker.py

This script allows the user to select parking spots manually on a static image and save their coordinates using pickle. It displays rectangles around selected spots for visual confirmation.

#### Usage

```bash
python ParkingSpacePicker.py
```

### 2. main.py
This script processes a video feed (carPark.mp4) to detect parking spot occupancy based on the coordinates saved by ParkingSpacePicker.py. It marks each parking spot in the video feed with a colored rectangle and annotates the count of free spaces.

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. carParkImg.png
An example image used by ParkingSpacePicker.py to select parking spots.

### 4. CarParkPos
Pickle file storing the coordinates of selected parking spots.

### 5. output.mp4
Output video file generated by main.py, showing the processed video with marked parking spots.

## Installation
### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/parking-spot-detection.git
cd parking-spot-detection
```

### Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone
```

### Usage
Run ParkingSpacePicker.py to select parking spots on carParkImg.png.
Run main.py to process carPark.mp4 and detect parking spot occupancy.
View the output video output.mp4 generated by main.py.
